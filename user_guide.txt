General
📏
Status Thresholds & On-Track Targets
The application uses standardized thresholds to determine TSE queue health status. Understanding these thresholds is essential for interpreting all metrics throughout the application.

🎯
On-Track Target: 80%+
Team Goal: The target is for 80% or more of TSEs to be "on track" at any given time. This ensures optimal queue health and customer experience.

Why 80%: This target accounts for normal variations in workload, temporary spikes, and allows for some TSEs to be temporarily over limits while maintaining overall team performance.

✅
On-Track Calculation
Definition: A TSE is considered "on track" if they meet BOTH of the following thresholds simultaneously:

Open Conversations: ≤ 5 active, non-snoozed conversations
Waiting on TSE: ≤ 5 conversations snoozed with the "snooze.waiting-on-tse" tag
Important Notes:

Both conditions must be met - if either threshold is exceeded, the TSE is not on track
"Waiting on TSE" specifically refers to conversations with the "snooze.waiting-on-tse" tag, not all snoozed conversations
Conversations waiting on customer (with "snooze.waiting-on-customer" tags) do not count toward the waiting-on-TSE threshold
Calculation Formula: For any group of TSEs, On-Track % = (Number of TSEs meeting both thresholds / Total TSEs) × 100

⭐
Status Levels
Four distinct status levels:

⭐️
Outstanding
0 open AND 0 waiting on TSE

Perfect performance - no active workload. TSE has completed all assigned work and has no pending items.

On Track
≤5 open AND ≤5 waiting

Within acceptable limits. TSE is managing their queue effectively and meeting performance standards.

Over Limit - Needs Attention
>5 open OR >5 waiting

Exceeds thresholds and requires attention. May need workload redistribution or support.

🚨
Alert Thresholds vs. Soft Limits
Two-Tier System: The application uses two sets of thresholds for different purposes:

Soft Limits (On-Track Thresholds):
Open Chats: ≤ 5
Waiting on TSE: ≤ 5
Used to determine "On Track" status. TSEs meeting these limits are considered compliant.

Alert Thresholds:
Open Chats Alert: 6+ conversations
Waiting on TSE Alert: 7+ conversations
Trigger notifications when exceeded. These are higher thresholds that indicate a TSE needs immediate attention.

Why Different: Soft limits define acceptable performance, while alert thresholds identify situations requiring immediate intervention. This two-tier system prevents alert fatigue while maintaining clear performance standards.

📊
Threshold Values
Metric	Soft Limit (On-Track)	Alert Threshold
Open Conversations	≤ 5	≥ 6
Waiting on TSE	≤ 5	≥ 7
🔔
Alerts System
The alerts system proactively identifies TSEs who need immediate attention, helping managers quickly address queue health issues before they impact customer experience.

🔔
Alert Dropdown
Access: Click the bell icon (🔔) in the top navigation header. The icon displays a badge with the total count of active alerts.

What It Shows: A dropdown menu listing all TSEs currently exceeding alert thresholds, organized by alert type.

Features:

Total alert count displayed as a badge on the bell icon
Alerts grouped by type (Open Chats vs. Waiting on TSE)
Each alert shows TSE name, alert type, and severity
Click any TSE name to navigate directly to their TSE card
"View All" button filters the TSE View to show only TSEs with alerts
"View Chats" button navigates to Conversations View filtered to that TSE's conversations
⚠️
Alert Types & Severity
Two Alert Types:

Open Chat Alerts: Triggered when a TSE has 6 or more open conversations
Waiting On TSE Alerts: Triggered when a TSE has 7 or more conversations waiting on them (tagged "snooze.waiting-on-tse")
Severity Levels: Alerts are automatically assigned severity based on how far over the threshold:

High Severity (🔴): TSE exceeds threshold by 3+ conversations
Open Chats: 9+ conversations
Waiting on TSE: 10+ conversations
Medium Severity (🟡): TSE exceeds threshold but by less than 3 conversations
Open Chats: 6 to 8 conversations
Waiting on TSE: 7 to 9 conversations
Real-Time Updates: Alerts update automatically as conversation counts change, ensuring you always have current information.

Assigned TSE information
Why This Tab Matters: Response time directly impacts customer satisfaction. This tab helps identify patterns, volume impacts, and trends in response time performance, enabling data-driven improvements to customer experience.

🔗
Impact Tab
Purpose: Analyzes the correlation between queue health (on-track status) and customer experience (response times), answering the critical question: "Does maintaining on-track status improve or worsen response times?"

Key Question: Is there a relationship between how well TSEs manage their queues (on-track %) and how quickly customers receive responses?

Date Range & TSE Filter: Shared with other Analytics tabs. Select date range and TSEs to analyze.

Correlation KPI Cards: Four cards showing correlation metrics:

5+ Min Wait Correlation: Correlation between on-track % and 5+ minute wait rate
Shows correlation coefficient (-1 to +1)
Strength: Weak (<0.3), Moderate (0.3-0.7), Strong (>0.7)
Direction: Positive or Negative
Color-coded: Green for negative correlation (desired), Red for positive correlation (concerning)
5-10 Min Wait Correlation: Same analysis for 5-10 minute wait category
10+ Min Wait Correlation: Same analysis for 10+ minute wait category
Improvement Potential: Shows potential wait time reduction if team maintains high (80-100%) on-track performance
Displays potential reduction for 5-10 min and 10+ min categories
Color-coded: Green for reductions (positive), Red for increases (negative/concerning)
Based on comparing current averages vs high-performance-day averages
Correlation Interpretation:

Negative Correlation (Desired): Higher on-track % → Lower wait times
Indicates that better queue management leads to faster customer responses
Validates that on-track efforts improve customer experience
Shown in green
Positive Correlation (Concerning): Higher on-track % → Higher wait times
Would suggest that on-track efforts might be slowing down responses
Would indicate a need to review processes
Shown in red
Weak Correlation: Little to no relationship between metrics
Scatter Plot:

Type: Scatter plot visualization
X-Axis: On-track percentage (0-100%)
Y-Axis: Slow response rate percentage (5+ minute waits)
Each Point: Represents one day's data
Purpose: Visual identification of patterns, trends, and outliers
Trend Line: Shows the overall relationship direction
Performance by On-Track Range:

What: Three cards grouping days by on-track performance level
Ranges:
High (80-100%): Days when 80%+ of TSEs were on-track
Medium (60-79%): Days when 60-79% of TSEs were on-track
Low (0-59%): Days when less than 60% of TSEs were on-track
Each Card Shows:
Number of days in that range
Average on-track percentage for those days
Average slow response rate percentage
Total slow responses and total conversations
Color Coding: Green border (High), Yellow border (Medium), Red border (Low)
Purpose: Compare response time performance across different on-track performance levels
Trend Over Time Chart:

Type: Dual-axis line chart
Left Y-Axis: On-track percentage (green line)
Right Y-Axis: Slow response rate percentage (red line)
Purpose: Visualize how both metrics change together over time
Interpretation: When lines move in opposite directions (green up, red down), it indicates negative correlation - desired outcome
Correlation Calculation:

Method: Pearson correlation coefficient
Formula: Measures linear relationship between two variables
Data Points: Requires at least 3 days of matching data (on-track snapshot + response time metric for same date)
Result Range: -1 (perfect negative correlation) to +1 (perfect positive correlation)
Zero: No correlation
Improvement Potential Calculation:

Method: Compares current average wait rates vs wait rates on high-performance days (80-100% on-track)
Formula: Improvement = Current Average - High-Performance Average
Positive Value: Indicates potential reduction (green) - maintaining high on-track could reduce wait times
Negative Value: Indicates potential increase (red) - concerning, suggests high on-track days had worse wait times
Requires: At least one day with 80%+ on-track performance in the selected range
What If Scenario:

Visualization: Chart showing potential impact of maintaining high on-track performance
Shows: Current vs projected wait time percentages
Purpose: Quantifies the potential customer experience improvement from better queue management
Why This Tab Matters: Validates whether queue management efforts (maintaining on-track status) actually improve customer experience. A negative correlation proves that better queue health leads to faster responses, justifying the focus on on-track metrics. This data-driven approach helps prioritize initiatives and measure impact.
