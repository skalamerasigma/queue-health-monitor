Operational Live Chat Metrics & Dashboard Targets
This document outlines the high-level targets for the new dashboard. The goal is to define where we expect operational live chat metrics to be in order to better manage the live chat queue.

Proposed Metrics & Targets

## Response Time & Customer Experience Metrics
Initial Response Time: 2 min
% of Conversations with <10 Min Response Time: [TBD] (Currently tracking 10+ min rate)
Average Response Time: [TBD]
Median Response Time: [TBD]
Time to First Response (P50/P95): [TBD]
CSAT: 4.8

## Queue Health & Compliance Metrics
Compliance Rate (% TSEs meeting both thresholds): 80%+ (Target from rollout doc)
- Open Chats Compliance: ≤5 per TSE (Soft Limit)

Alert Frequency (threshold violations per day): [TBD]
- Open Chats Alerts: 6+ per TSE
- Waiting on TSE Alerts: 7+ per TSE
Unassigned Conversations: [TBD]

- Median Wait Time for Unassigned: [TBD] hours
Oldest Ticket in Queue: [TBD] hours
Average Open Conversations per TSE: [TBD] (Target: ≤5)

## Volume & Capacity Metrics
Number of Tickets Taken by TSE: 13
Average Conversations per TSE per Day: [TBD]
Total Daily Conversation Volume: [TBD]
Peak Hours Load Distribution: [TBD]
TSE Utilization Rate: [TBD]%
Coverage Hours: [TBD] (Note: Target differs for 6 chat hours)

## Resolution & Closure Metrics
Time to Close: [TBD]
Average Handle Time: [TBD]
% of Tickets Closed Same Day: [TBD]
First Contact Resolution Rate: [TBD]%
Resolution Rate (within SLA): [TBD]%
Average Conversations per Resolution: [TBD]

## Snooze & Workflow Metrics
Number of Tickets Snoozed by EOW: [TBD]
Average Snooze Duration: [TBD]
- Waiting on TSE Snoozes: [TBD] hours (48hr auto-reassign)
- Waiting on Customer Resolved: [TBD] hours (24hr auto-close)
- Waiting on Customer Unresolved: [TBD] hours (72hr auto-close)
Snooze Rate (% of conversations snoozed): [TBD]
Reassignment Frequency: [TBD]
Auto-close Rate (% closed by automation): [TBD]

## Efficiency & Productivity Metrics
Efficiency: 2.5 (Note: Target differs for 6 chat hours)
Availability: 210 (Note: Target differs for 6 chat hours)
Conversations per Hour per TSE: [TBD]
Average Active Conversations per TSE: [TBD]
Queue Backlog Growth Rate: [TBD]% (week-over-week)

## Quality & Escalation Metrics
Escalation Rate (% escalated): [TBD]
Escalation Time (time to escalate): [TBD]
Customer Wait Time (for waiting-on-customer conversations): [TBD]
- Resolved: [TBD] hours
- Unresolved: [TBD] hours
Follow-up Rate (% requiring follow-up): [TBD]

## Regional & Team Metrics
Regional Compliance Comparison: [TBD]
- UK Region Compliance: [TBD]%
- NY Region Compliance: [TBD]%
- SF Region Compliance: [TBD]%
- Other Region Compliance: [TBD]%
Team-wide Compliance Trend: Improving (vs. worsening/stable)
Region Load Distribution: [TBD]

## Historical & Trend Metrics
7-Day Moving Average Compliance: [TBD]%
Week-over-Week Compliance Change: [TBD]%
Monthly Compliance Trend: [TBD] (improving/worsening/stable)
Response Time Trend: [TBD] (improving/worsening/stable)
Volatility (Standard Deviation): [TBD] (lower = more consistent)

## Additional Considerations
Zendesk Statuses: Potential to integrate ZD statuses into the dashboard.
ZD/JIRA Tickets: Consider tracking the number of tickets (needs further definition).
Away Mode Impact: Track TSEs with away mode enabled and impact on queue distribution.
Performance Streaks: Track consecutive days of compliance (3+ days = streak).
Customer Satisfaction Correlation: Analyze relationship between response time and CSAT.

## Next Steps
Verify Data: Cross-reference proposed numbers with Glean, Confluence, or Support Daily stats to ensure accuracy.
Review: Discuss which of the listed targets are most relevant for the dashboard and queue management.
Prioritize: Identify which metrics are most critical for immediate implementation vs. future enhancements.
Set Baselines: Establish current performance baselines before setting improvement targets.
Define SLAs: If applicable, define Service Level Agreements for response time, resolution time, etc.
