## Slide 3: The Problem We're Solving
**Current State:**
- ❌ Ad-hoc monitoring
- ❌ Manual checks
- ❌ Reactive responses
- ❌ Limited visibility into performance
- ❌ No historical trend analysis

**Goal:**
- ✅ Proactive, measurable queue management
- ✅ Data-driven accountability
- ✅ Automated workflows
- ✅ Real-time visibility

---

## Slide 4: What's Changing? (Part 1)
### New Queue Health Monitor Dashboard

**Real-Time Visibility:**
- Color-coded compliance status (Green/Yellow/Red)
- Live metrics: Open chats, snoozed conversations, waiting times
- Automated alerts when thresholds exceeded
- Region-based breakdowns

**Historical Analytics:**
- Compliance trends over time
- Response time tracking
- Region comparisons
- Individual TSE performance tracking

---

## Slide 5: What's Changing? (Part 2)
### Standardized Snooze Workflows

**Three Automated Workflows:**

1. **🟡 Waiting on TSE - Deep Dive [48hr Auto-reassign]**
   - Investigations, bug filing, internal consultations
   - Auto-reassigns after 24 hours if no activity

2. **🟢 Waiting on Customer - Resolved [24hr Auto-close]**
   - Resolved issues waiting on customer confirmation
   - Auto-closes after 24 hours

3. **🟠 Waiting on Customer - Unresolved [72hr Auto-close]**
   - Unresolved issues waiting on customer input
   - Auto-closes after 72 hours

**Benefits:** Automated follow-ups, consistent tagging, reduced manual work

## Slide 6: What We Expect to Achieve

### Immediate Benefits
✅ Proactive queue management  
✅ Clear accountability metrics  
✅ Reduced manual work  
✅ Better visibility for all  

### Long-term Goals
📈 80%+ compliance rate  
📉 Reduced alert frequency  
⚡ Improved response times  
📊 Data-driven capacity planning  

### Success Metrics
- Compliance Rate (% meeting thresholds)
- Alert Frequency (violations per day)
- Response Time (% <10 min)
- Trend Direction (improving/worsening/stable)

---

## Slide 7: Compliance Targets

### Daily Goals
- **Open Chats**: 0 (Ideal) or ≤5 (Soft Limit)
- **Actionable Snoozed**: ≤5 (Soft Limit)
- **Customer Wait**: No limit

### Alert Thresholds
- ⚠️ **6+ Open Chats** → Manager alert
- ⚠️ **7+ Actionable Snoozed** → Manager alert

**Status Indicators:**
- 🟢 Green = Compliant (meeting both thresholds)
- 🟡 Yellow = Warning (within soft limits)
- 🔴 Red = Non-Compliant (exceeds soft limit)
